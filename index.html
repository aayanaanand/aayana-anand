                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm Aayana (she/her), and I'm a rising junior at the University of Michigan School of Information. I'm majoring in Information Analysis. I’m currently working as a summer 2023 Data Analyst Intern at Stryker in the Customer Solutions Division at the Kalamazoo world headquarters.</p>
                    <p>I was born in Canada, but I've spent most of my life in Michigan. I’m a first generation American and daughter of South Asian immigrants, and my culture/life experiences have always shaped my work. It’s because of my identity and upbringing that I place an especially high value on diversity, equity, and inclusion in social spaces and workplaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>My passion is leveraging data/technology/information for social good – using technical skills to gain insights about the world and subsequently use those insights to find solutions to problems. In the process, I aim to approach my work collaboratively, ethically, and with an agile mindset.
                    </p>
                    <p>My experiences span many subjects/fields, from media production to data analysis to consulting. I’m particularly interested in biomedicine and bioinformatics, but I'm open to any sector and always excited to learn new things.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you have any requests or inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact me.
                    </p>
