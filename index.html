                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Aayana Anand (she/her), and I'm a senior at the University of Michigan, obtaining my Bachelors of Science in Information from the School of Information (UMSI). I'm majoring in Information/Data Analysis and obtaining a certificate of Leadership. <b>I am seeking full-time work opportunities in the U.S. starting Summer 2025, in any role pertaining to data/market/business analytics, consulting, strategy, or adjacent functions.</b></p>
                    <p>My most recent work experiences have been internships at Stryker in Kalamazoo, MI. I was a Data Analytics Intern in Summer 2023, and I was rehired as a Market Analytics Intern in 2024. I have interned at diiVe (Market Consulting) and KPMG Australia (Data Analytics). I'm also heavily involved on campus. I currently work as an Instructional Aide for both SI 301 (Models of Social Information Processing) and SI 539 (Accessible Web Design). I'm also an Instructional Aide for SI 300 (Career and Internship Studio), also known as a B.S.I Peer Coach. I'm Co-President of What the F, an intersectional feminist creative media organization. Finally, I'm the Lead Applied Leadership Fellow for the UM Barger Leadership Institute.</p>
                    <p>I was born in Canada, but I've spent most of my life in Michigan. I’m a first generation American and daughter of South Asian immigrants, so my culture/life experiences have always shaped my work. It’s because of my identity and upbringing that I place an especially high value on diversity, equity, and inclusion in social spaces and workplaces.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>My passion is leveraging data/technology/information for social good – using technical skills to gain insights about the world and subsequently use those insights to find solutions to problems. In the process, I aim to approach my work collaboratively, ethically, and with an agile mindset.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of my work, I love trying out coffee/boba shops, listening to music, watching rom-coms, and hanging out with my friends! 
                    </p>
