                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Aayana Anand (she/her), and I'm a junior at the University of Michigan, obtaining my Bachelors of Science in Information from the School of Information (UMSI). I'm majoring in Information/Data Analysis and obtaining a certificate of Leadership. This past summer, I worked as a Data Analytics Intern at Stryker in the Customer Solutions Division at the Kalamazoo world headquarters, and <b>I'm excited to announce that I will be returning to Customer Solutions as a Market Analytics Intern in Summer 2024.</b></p>
                    <p>In addition to my experience at Stryker, I have completed previous internship programs at diiVe (Market Consulting) and KPMG Australia (Data Analytics). I'm also heavily involved on campus. I work as an Instructional Aide for an introductory Python class (SI 106) within UMSI. I am co-director of the Podcast and Blog team for What the F, an intersectional feminist organization. I'm an Applied Leadership Fellow and Grants Specialist for the UM Barger Leadership Institute.</p>
                    <p>I was born in Canada, but I've spent most of my life in Michigan. I’m a first generation American and daughter of South Asian immigrants, so my culture/life experiences have always shaped my work. It’s because of my identity and upbringing that I place an especially high value on diversity, equity, and inclusion in social spaces and workplaces.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>My passion is leveraging data/technology/information for social good – using technical skills to gain insights about the world and subsequently use those insights to find solutions to problems. In the process, I aim to approach my work collaboratively, ethically, and with an agile mindset.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of my work, I am a HUGE Swiftie. I love trying out coffee/boba shops, watching rom-coms, and hanging out with my friends! 
                    </p>
